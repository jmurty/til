# Markdown Table of Contents (ToC)

The [Markdown All in One][1] VSCode extension includes a Table of Contents
(ToC) feature to create and keep a ToC up-to-date.

In a markdown file, run `Markdown All in One: Create Table of Contents` to
create one. The contents will be kept up-to-date automatically on save.

Configure the levels included in the ToC with the setting
`markdown.extension.toc.levels` e.g:

```json
"markdown.extension.toc.levels": "3..6"
```
